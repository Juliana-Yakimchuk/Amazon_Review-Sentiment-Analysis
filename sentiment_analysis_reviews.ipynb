    "2. Language models require large computational power and amounts of data, since the feature space is as a rule very large. \n",
    "3. NLP is also challenging in terms of data preparation. Different models require different input format, and even built-in preprocessors still ofteen require a lot of addiitonal steps. \n",
    "4. In terms of the specific dataset we chose - reviews are highly subjective and the same defects in the product can be calssified by reviewers as accceptable and overall positive or unacceptable and negative. We can think of such data as crowd-sourced data labeling. There are no experts, who can use objective criteria to determine if the text has positive or negative connotation. Every reviewer has their own assessment of the same product."

    "### In our project we investigated different model architectures for performing NLP sentiment analysis. We were able to achieve the best accuracy of ~86% with the best perorming model (DistilBERT), with an F1-score of 62 for the minor class. Our opinion is that further hyperparameter tuning and trying other architectures will further improve the performance of the model. In fact, even Bidirectional LSTM could be further improved and is much faster in terms of training than  transformers with transfer learning. "
